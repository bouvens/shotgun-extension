# Shotgun Extension Prototype

### [Demo](https://bouvens.github.io/#shotgun)

## Whatâ€™s This?

It's a PoC of a browser extension that allows you to shoot web pages. Now, it's included in one demo page and can be run from its [section](https://bouvens.github.io/#shotgun).

## How It Works
Hold `Shift` for slow motion.

Hold `Cmd` or `Ctrl` to increase damage.

Reload a page to reset.

## How to Run Locally

Run in bash
```bash
git clone git@github.com:bouvens/shotgun-extension.git
cd shotgun-extension
npm install
```

Then, you can run `demo/index.html` with some web server or IDE. The server is not included, sorry. It's just a PoC.
